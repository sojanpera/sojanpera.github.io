[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am a quantitative researcher studying the intersection of development, digitalization, and the role of data. My doctoral thesis at the Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford investigates the relationship between accessing work through online platforms and skill development. My doctoral research is funded by The Alan Turing Institute, the UK’s national institute for data science and AI, where I also co-convene the Data and Inequality Interest Group. I am additionally a visiting researcher at the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, University College London.\nIn addition to my doctoral studies, I work as a research assistant in the Fairwork project, where I am in charge of the quantitative analysis for the TVET and New Work in the Indian Platform Economy project, which focuses on the intersection of digital labour platforms, skills development, and development cooperation. In this role I analyse survey data on platform workers in India. I have previously taught computational and social research methods courses at the Saïd Business School and the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford, which focus on social network analysis and economic development in the digital age, respectively.\nBefore commencing my doctoral studies I worked as the quantitative research lead in an ERC-funded GeoNet project hosted at the OII, and which studied how new economic practices and processes are taking root in Sub-Saharan Africa as a result of changing connectivities. Before joining the OII, I worked with the Digital Engagement team of the World Bank Governance Global Practice and the Inter-American Development Bank’s Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness Unit. I hold a MA in International Development from American University’s School of International Service. At SIS I studied international development, governance, and quantitative research methods as an ASLA-Fulbright Fellow.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sojanpera.github.io/author/sanna-ojanpera/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/sanna-ojanpera/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a quantitative researcher studying the intersection of development, digitalization, and the role of data.

Nulle part cela n’est plus visible qu’en Afrique subsaharienne. La région passe d’un état de déconnexion numérique à un état où des centaines de millions de citoyens sont connectés à l’économie numérique. Ce changement de connectivité a engendré beaucoup d’espoir et d’enthousiasme pour les potentiels d’une économie de connaissance émergente dans la région. En théorie, l’Afrique subsaharienne peut concourir avec le reste du monde dans la compétition pour la production de tous les biens et services numériques. L’article examine l’état actuel de notre recherche pluriannuelle, en cours, sur le sujet, fondée sur une recherche empirique dans un ensemble de secteurs et de domaines (y compris l’écriture de code
